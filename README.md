# HR_Management_System

Currently interning as a Full-Stack Developer at INSA, I'm contributing to a critical project that aligns with their mission of secure development. The project involves modernizing the agency's monolithic HR management system by transitioning it to a microservices architecture. This shift aims to improve scalability, maintainability, and overall security. My responsibilities include:
-  Backend Development
-  Contributing to the development of new microservices using Spring Boot,
-  Focusing on specific functionalities of the HR system and Working with the frontend development team ( utilizing React and a micro-frontends approach) to ensure seamless integration between the microservices and the user interface.
-  Integration
-  Testing

N.B: the project is in progress
